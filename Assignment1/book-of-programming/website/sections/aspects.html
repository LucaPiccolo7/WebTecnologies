        <h1>The Two Aspects</h1>

        <p>
            Below the surface of the machine, the program <strong>moves</strong>. Without effort,
            it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter and
            regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water.
            <em>The essence stays invisible below</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the creators built the machine, they put in the
            <strong>processor and the memory</strong>. 
            From these arise the two aspects of the program.    
        </p>
        <p>
            The aspect of the processor is the <em>active substance</em>. It is called
            <strong>Control</strong>. The aspect of the memory is the <em>passive substance</em>. It is
            called <strong>Data</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data is made of merely <strong>bits</strong>, yet it takes complex forms. Control
            consists only of simple <strong>instructions</strong>, yet it performs difficult
            tasks. From the small and trivial, the large and complex arise.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>program source</strong> is <em>Data</em>. <em>Control</em> arises from it. The Control
            proceeds to create new Data. The one is born from the other, the
            other is useless without the one. This is the harmonious cycle of
            Data and Control.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Of themselves</strong>, Data and Control are <em>without structure</em>. The programmers
            of old moulded their programs out of this raw substance. Over time,
            the amorphous Data has crystallised into data types, and the chaotic
            Control was restricted into control structures and functions.
