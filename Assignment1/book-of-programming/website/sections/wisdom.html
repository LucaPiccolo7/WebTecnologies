            A student was complaining about <strong>digital numbers</strong>.<br>
            'When I take the root of two and then square it again, the <em>result is already inaccurate</em>!'.<br>
            Overhearing him, Fu-Tzu laughed, and said:<br>
            'Here is a sheet of paper. Write down the <em>precise value of the square root of two</em> for me'.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fu-Tzu said:<br> 'When you cut against the grain of the wood, much strength
            is needed'.<br>
            <strong>
                'When you program against the grain of a problem, much code
                is needed.'
            </strong>

            Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were boasting about the size of their latest
            programs.<br>
            <strong>'Two-hundred thousand lines'</strong>, said Tzu-li, 
            <em>'not counting comments!'</em>.<br> 
            'Psah', said Tzu-ssu, <strong>'mine is almost a MILLION lines
            already'</strong>.<br> Fu-Tzu said 'My best program has five hundred lines.'<br>
            Hearing this, Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were enlightened.
