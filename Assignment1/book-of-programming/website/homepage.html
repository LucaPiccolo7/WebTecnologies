        <h1>The book of programming</h1>
        <p>
            <a href="/homepage.html">This website</a> 
            contains fragments from the 
            <strong>Book of Programming</strong>, 
            <em>an ancient tome lost to time.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The book is said to have been written by a disciple of 
            <a href="/people/fu-tzu.html">Fu-Tzu</a>,
            <em>the legendary master programmer</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, two sections have been recovered:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A section describing the <a href="/sections/aspects.html">two aspects</a> of <strong>programming</strong> (data and control);
                </li>
                <li>
                    A section reporting <a href="/sections/wisdom.html">short-sayings</a> and other <strong>wisdom</strong> of the master Fu-Tzu.
                </li>
            </ul>
